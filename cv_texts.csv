SUMMARY 
 
 
I intend to be a part of an organization where I can constantly learn and 
develop my technical skills and make best use of it for the growth of the 
organization. Passionately looking forward to apply my logical, analytical 
and coding skills while adapting to new technologies to solve complex 
problems. 
 
PROJECTS 
 
 
 
 
Get-A-Way Travel Companion App 
I developed an interactive android app which would assist the travellers 
by providing them the optimal route for travelling between multiple 
places using Google’s Distance Matrix API. It was implemented using a 
modified travelling salesman problem. Database was maintained on 
Xampp server using php. 
 
 
Texture Classification using Convolutional Neural Network 
Deep Learning research based project. The project deals with image 
augmentation by integrating spectral and spatial features using wavelet 
transformation. Successfully reduced the trainable parameters by 4.1 
million and training time by 61.13% for texture classification on 
Describable Texture Dataset (DTD) . 
 
 
Food Runner App 
During my summer training I developed an interactive food ordering app 
which fetches the restaurants’ data from an API as well as maintains 
user’s data such as his past orders and favourite restaurants using the 
concepts of multithreading. Used Volley to send get and post requests to 
the server and room library to maintain a SQLite database. Used 
RecylerView and fragments to display data in an organized manner. 
 
 
SUMMER TRAINING 
 
 
 
As part of summer training I completed a six weeks online training on 
Android App Development by Internshala with a score of 100/100.

TRAINING [May 2020- June 2020]  
  
• 
Six weeks summer training program in machine learning at Internshala.   
• 
The training consisted of various modules related to different machine learning algorithms such as 
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Clustering besides 
topics such as selecting the right model, Feature Engineering, Basics of Ensemble Models etc., which 
aimed to scrutinize the performance of the apprentice.   
• 
Worked on a project which aimed at predicting the propensity of a customer to churn in a bank using 
logistic regression and random forest.   
  
PROJECTS  
1. Prediction of cardiovascular disease using ML algorithms [June 2020]  
• 
The project aims on predicting Cardiovascular Diseases in people using Machine Learning algorithms.   
• 
The algorithms included are K-Neighbors Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier and              
Logistic Regression Classifier.  
• 
Later on, comparison is done among all the respective models with regard to their accuracy.  
  
Project URL: https://github.com/mishrashubhangi/CV_disease  
  
2. Prediction of customer churn in a bank using ML algorithms [May 2020-June 2020]  
• 
It is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one for a bank. Thus, it is advantageous 
for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.  
• 
Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many 
customers as possible.  
• 
In this project, the customers who are likely to churn balances below the minimum balance are identified on the 
basis of customers information such as age, gender, demographics along with their transactions with the bank.  
• 
Different machine algorithms, such as logistic regression and random forest are used to predict the propensity to 
churn for each customer, along with the comparison of the accuracy for the respective ml algorithms.  
  
     Project URL: https://github.com/mishrashubhangi/ML-Projects/find/master  
  
     3.  Developing a learning tool for kids using Augmented Reality [Feb 2020 – May 2020]  
• 
The project aims at motivating and engaging children in interactive learning activities in order to promote their 
cognitive and social skills using augmented reality. Among new age technologies, augmented reality has a special 
ability to catch children’s imagination and promote attention, within safe and fascinating environments.  
• 
In this research, the three-dimensional (3D) display [augmented reality] visual display based on the computer are 
constructed for the students with special needs to do “Theory of Mind” questions.  
  
    
   
4. Mental Stress Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms [Aug 2019-Nov 2019]  
• 
The objective of the project is to develop a framework for the detection and analysis of stress/anxiety emotional 
states of the students. The analysis mainly focuses on certain parameters such as peer pressure, parental pressure, 
social anxiety etc. in order to estimate the emotional representation of the students more objectively.  
• 
The purpose of this project is to determine the level of stress in individuals by using state-of-art machine learning 
algorithms.  
• 
Created my own dataset by using a questionnaire, consisting of 20 questions in which each subject belonged to a 
sub-category of common stressors in an individual’s life. The responses to the questionnaire were analysed, using 
a variety of ml techniques to elucidate the level of stress.   
• 
The questionnaire formulated by me is inspired from the PSS Test by Sheldon Cohen.

Blockchain is a trusted distributed ledger shared across the business processes. Blockchain technology focuses on automating tasks in a distributed
environment. The technology of Blockchain could be efficiently used in the sector of supply chain management and has turned out as the best
alternative in comparison to the traditional paper-based systems. Proving as one of the effective platforms, it helps in mapping the physical
commodities to the digital ledger. A digital ledger is like an electronic register for storing the transactions that are taking place among various
nodes/commodities. The physical commodities include suppliers, gatherers/manufacturers, exporters, consumers and distributors wherein the
distributor plays a major role in determining the product standards. Supply chain management platforms requires a lot of involvement of different
individuals on a larger scale and hence the project deals with mapping the physical commodities or the entities in the supply chain management of
coffee into a digital ledger so that all the required tasks performed by the individuals can be collated and verified. This would also help in reduction of
the paper work in the supply chain management of coffee and ease in validating all the transactions between the physical commodities like
Gatherers/Manufacturers, Supplier, Distributors and Consumers. In short, we can say that Blockchain technology can bring transparency,
sustainability and efficiency to the coffee industry.

A Review Paper on Regulating Bitcoin Currencies

Key Skills: Bitcoin  Blockchain  Cryptocurrency
 Cryptography
 Technical Writing  Review  Literature
Before the advent of Bitcoin, there was no mechanism to allow any two willing parties to make transactions between them without any involvement of
a third party. Third parties were included in the process to prevent fraud. Hence, involving a third party meant extra charges for transaction which is
a downside of the present online transaction system. Double-spending is an issue of digital currencies because digital tokens can be replicated easily
and the transaction parties cannot verify the bona fides of the digital currency. Bitcoin has a procedure to prevent double-counting and check the
authenticity of each transaction. Bitcoin cryptocurrency is based on the concept of cryptography, blockchain and peer-to-peer version of electronic
cash. The Bitcoin network is growing significantly as there are no prerequisites required for making an account or investment in Bitcoin so it is
 basically a network open for all. Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency which is the reason for its popularity. This cryptocurrency opens up a
whole new platform for financial transactions.
